# Python Environment & Package Management in Docker LXC (Debian 12)

This guide documents how we configured Python inside a Docker LXC container running on Debian 12, including the use of `pip` as `root`, best practices, and how to document dependencies.

---

## ✅ Current Environment

- **Python version:** 3.11.2
- **pip version:** Installed using `apt install python3-pip`
- **Installed Package:** `python-dotenv` via `pip3 install python-dotenv`
- **Note:** Installed as `root`

---

## ⚠️ About the Root Warning

You may see a warning like this:

```
WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead
```

### Should You Worry?
- Since this is a self-contained Docker LXC container used for automation scripts, running pip as root **is acceptable**.
- If you were building a development environment or deploying system-wide Python software, a virtual environment would be strongly recommended.

**✅ Conclusion:** In this case, the warning can be safely ignored.

## 📦 Managing Python Dependencies

### Create a `requirements.txt`
To track your installed Python packages, run:

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will generate a file like:

```text
python-dotenv==1.1.0
```

### Install from `requirements.txt` in future rebuilds:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🗂️ GitHub Integration
You can push your scripts and this documentation into a new GitHub repo.

Example structure:

```
scripts/
├── add-jackett-indexers.py
├── .env.indexers
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Let me know and I can generate the `README.md` content and `.gitignore` for the scripts repo too.
