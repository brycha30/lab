MD-Chamberlain Homelab Runbook — Repo Build Log
==============================================

Issue:
- Git repo could NOT be initialized on /mnt/Main (network mount) due to chmod/permissions:
  error: chmod on .../.git/config.lock failed: Operation not permitted
  fatal: could not set 'core.filemode' to 'false'

Resolution:
- Keep the *actual* git working repo locally in the container:
  /root/git/md-chamberlain-homelab
- Use /mnt/Main only as a persistence/sync target (not a git working directory).

Repo created:
- /root/git/md-chamberlain-homelab
- Branch: main
- Added: README.md, .gitignore
